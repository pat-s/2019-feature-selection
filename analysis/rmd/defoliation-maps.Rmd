# Predicted defoliation (absolute)

Predicted defoliation by XGBOOST on 20 m spatial resolution in the Basque Country.

With an RMSE of 36 % (for a range of 0 - 100), the model focuses its prediction to the mean of the response range (0 - 100) to achieve acceptable performance results on the test set.

The following vegetation indices have been used, selected by the internal variable importance rating of XGBOOST:

- EVI
- GDVI4
- GDVI3
- GDVI2
- D1
- mNDVI
- mSR

# Optimization path of hyperparameter tuning

The following shows the optimization path (RMSE) of the hyperparameter tuning for the XGBOOST model using 20 MBO iterations (with a starting design of 30).

```{r}
getOptPathY(tune_xgboost$opt.path)
```

Some more details on the optimization path are presented below:

```{r}
plotOptPath(tune_xgboost$opt.path)
```

# Predicted Defoliation (relative)

Since these absolute values do not reflect the truth, we decided to create a relative Index from the predicted absolute values.

This was done by calling 

```{r , eval=FALSE}
scale(data$defoliation, center = FALSE,
      scale = max(data$defoliation, na.rm = TRUE)/100)
```

which re-scales the data from 0 - 100.
